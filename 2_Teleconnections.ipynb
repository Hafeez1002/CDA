        "The correlation map shows the remarkably wide-ranging impacts that ENSO has on global precipitation. Green colors in the map indicate above normal precipitation during El Niño conditions (positive correlation) and brown colors show below normal precipitation during El Niño conditions (negative correlation). Conversely, during La Niña conditions the precipitation is below normal in green regions and above normal in brown regions.\n",

        "Perhaps not surprinsingly, preciptiation in the tropical Pacific is strongly affected by ENSO with high preciptation across the region of high SSTs in El Niño conditions. El Niño conditions typically bring dry conditions to Indonesia and neighboring countries, sometimes leading to drought and wildfires. \n",

Depending on what region and climate extreme you select, you might find it useful to analyze some other climate oscillations.
